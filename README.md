# :coffee: LEARNING JAVA :coffee:
This is a series of tutorials and projects programmed in Java.<br>
The goal of these projects is to get a great understanding of Java language and some of the most important packages/frameworks built on top of it.<br>

<br>

Here are some of the resources that were used for this repository:

* [Java_Course_Basic](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLU8oAlHdN5BktAXdEVCLUYzvDyqRQJ2lk)
* [Java_Course_Intermediate](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyvsggKtwbLXEZjb8HrNTbWesTKIfpNak)
* [Spring_Course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLU8oAlHdN5Blq85GIxtKjIXdfHPksV_Hm)
* [JPA_Hibernate_Course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTd5ehIj0goPcnQs34i0F-Kgp5JHX8UUv)


# LEARNING JAVA BASICS :boom:
This repository covers the knowledge and basic concepts of Java projects. <br />
It begins with the necessary basic programming concepts (IDEs, variables, constants, classes, loops, etc). <br />
Then, it goes into more advanced topics and problem-solving, with good Object-Oriented-Programming approach!. <br />
The information of this repository is based on many online-tutorials and has a main purpose: learn and practice.<br />


## Dependencies :vertical_traffic_light:
The dependencies are mainly Java built-in libraries and the correct usage of them. <br />
My advice is to check the main Java API reference:
[Main_Java_API](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/)


### Software dependencies

* JAVA RUNTIME ENVIRONMENT<br />
I am working with a Java-Runtime-Environment 8 or greater.<br>

```
https://www.java.com/en/download/
```

* IDE <br />
There are many great IDEs for Java development. For these projects, I used eclipse as my main tool.<br>

```
https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/
```

## Usage :pencil2:
All projects are really well commented and most of them have specifications and remarks for their purpose and I/O.
I will be uploading most of the files, and try to keep it as clean as possible.


## Special thanks :gift:
* Thanks to all contributors for the great Java packages that I am using.
