This directory is my learning path in Java for the basic concepts.

## DATA TYPES

### Whole Numbers

* Byte: Numbers that take 1 byte of storage-space. In range (+/-128)

* Short: Numbers that take 2 bytes of storage-space. In range (+/- 32,768).


* Int: Numbers that take 4 bytes of storage-space. In range (+/- 2,147,483,648).

* Long: Numbers that take 8 bytes of storage-space. In range (+/- -9,223,372,036,854,775,808).

### Fractional Numbers

* Float: Numbers that take 4 bytes of storage-space. Sufficient for storing 6 to 7 decimal digits.

* Double: Numbers that take 8 bytes of storage-space. Sufficient for storing 15 decimal digits.

### Boolean Numbers

* Boolean: Numbers that take 1 bit of storage-space. True of False values.

### Characters

* Char: Store a single character or letter from the ASCII values.

## VARIABLES

We must specify the name and the data-type for all variables.

### Declare Variable Example 1:
>String my_var; <br>
>my_var = "Santiago";

### Initialize Variable Example 2:
>String my_var = "Santiago"

## CONSTANTS

They play an important role for always-fixed "variables". <br>
The way to to them is by adding "final" at the start of the statement.

### Create Constant Example:
>final double in_to_cm = 2.54;
